# Chapel Mode for Vim

Fork/mirror of the official vim plugin shipped with
[chapel](https://chapel-lang.org)


### Installation

With vim-plug:

`Plug 'nebulaeandstars/vim-chapel'`

With Vundle:

`Plugin 'nebulaeandstars/vim-chapel'`


### Changes from the original plugin

  - `.chpl` files are now called `chapel` files, rather than `chpl` files, to be
    more consistent with how vim refers to other languages' file-types.

  - The indentation component was removed, as it was fairly aggressive and
    assumed a lot about what you wanted.

  - It's on GitHub for easier integration with plugin managers.
